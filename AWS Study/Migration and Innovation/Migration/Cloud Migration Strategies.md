### Rehosting

Rehosting is also called **lift-and-shift**.
It is a process of moving applications without making any changes to them.

### Replatforming

Replatforming is also called **lift, tinker and shift**.
It is a process of moving applications with cloud optimizations.


### Refactoring

Refactoring is also called **re-architecting**.
It is a process of changing the application foundation/core and/or environment.
It helps with application scaling, performance, and further development.


### Repurchasing

Repurchasing is a process of changing business type.
It moves your application to a **software-as-a-service (SaaS)** model from a traditional model.

### Retaining

Retaining involves keeping crucial business applications.
It could include applications that require refactoring before migration.

### Retiring

It is a process of removing unnecessary applications.
