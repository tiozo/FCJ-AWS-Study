Traffic can be directed with Elastic Load Balancing.

### Elastic Load Balancing Service
This service distributes application traffic across services.
The [[Load Balancer]] is a single point of contact for incoming web traffic.
The single point of contact means that the traffic hits the load Balancer first, spreading out the load between resources.
The balancer accepts requests and directs them to the stances.
