### Containers in the cloud

Containers are objects, used to deploying and managing applications in the cloud.
The container provide an isolated environment, gives better resources management, removes dependencies to other components.
This is the core concept of microservices.

### Containerized Approach

Help debugging process easier because you only debugging a "process/services" at one time without affecting the other "healthy" services.
The container will remains consistent regardless of deployment.

### Container and Scale

It is important for scale when using containers. (Since it is copy-able, and can clone to multiple other object)
